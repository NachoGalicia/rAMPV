Intratumoral Administration of rAMPV-4 in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

Draft: First-in-Human Safety Assessment

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A draft protocol is presented for a Phase I clinical trial, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation using 3+3 design and dose expansion, to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic activity, and preliminary efficacy of the oncolytic virus rAMPV-4 administered by intratumoral injection in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The virus will be administered in a multiple injection schedule (2-3 doses separated by 7 days) in accessible hepatic metastatic lesions and/or other accessible metastatic sites (lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, peritoneum) and in primary tumor when technically feasible. The primary objective is to establish intratumoral safety, define dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and determine the recommended Phase IIb dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives include characterization of intratumoral viral replication, local immunologic infiltration, systemic immunologic response, and exploratory assessment of antitumor activity.

# 1. INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION

## 1.1. Clinical Context of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

<<Pending Development>>

## 1.2. Oncolytic Viruses: Mechanism of Action and Clinical Precedents

<<Pending Development>>

## 1.3. Justification for Intratumoral Administration

Intratumoral administration of oncolytic viruses provides several substantial scientific and clinical advantages supported by clinical literature:

**Pharmacokinetic Advantages:**

- Maximization of local virus concentration in target lesion with minimal systemic dilution
- Reduction of systemic exposure, with potential to decrease systemic toxicity compared to IV administration
- Prolongation of virus-tumor cell contact time
- Precise control of administered dose and intralesional distribution kinetics

**Clinical Advantages:**

- Facilitates direct intratumoral safety evaluation through minimally invasive image-guided procedures
- Allows serial biopsy collection (pre, Day 7, Day 28) for exhaustive mechanistic analysis of tumor microenvironment
- Has been the approved route of administration by FDA/EMA for authorized oncolytic viruses (T-VEC in melanoma)
- Minimizes risks of uncontrolled systemic viremia and off-target tissue replication

**Mechanistic Advantages:**

- High local concentration of viral and tumor antigens facilitates robust local immunologic priming in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs)
- Direct activation of antigen-presenting cells in situ (macrophages, dendritic cells)
- Potential for abscopal effect: local immunologic response propagates to distant non-injected metastatic lesions

## 1.4. Justification for Primary Colorectal/Rectal Tumor Inclusion

Although most oncolytic virus clinical trials have focused on accessible metastases, inclusion of primary tumor is possible when accessible.

### 1.4.1. Biologic Justification

**High tumor burden:** Primary tumor frequently represents the largest tumor mass in the patient, with complex microenvironment rich in stromal cells, infiltrating macrophages, and presence of regulatory and exhausted T cells. Intratumoral injection at this site can trigger robust viral replication and potent local immunologic response.

**Immunosuppressive nature:** The microenvironment of primary colorectal tumor is typically immunosuppressive (high TGF-β, IL-10, presence of Tregs), representing an opportunity to "reset" local immunology through immunogenic viral conditioning.

**Priming of systemic immunologic response:** Primary tumor has direct lymphatic drainage to locoregional lymph nodes (mesorectal in rectal cancer, colic in colon cancer), permitting direct priming of T and B cells in accessible and immunocompetent TDLNs.

### 1.4.2. Clinical Justification

**Applicability:** ~60-70% of mCRC patients present with primary tumor still in situ (unresected due to being unresectable associated with metastasis), representing large population candidate for primary injection.

**Simple Endoscopic Monitoring:** Unlike hepatic/pulmonary metastases requiring repeated imaging, primary colonic/rectal tumor injection is easily monitorable through routine clinical endoscopy/colonoscopy.

**Accessible Biopsy:** Sampling primary tumor for analysis of viral replication, local CD8+ infiltration, and cytokines is extremely straightforward through standard endoscopic forceps, without requiring percutaneous invasive procedures.

**Potential Complete Loco-regional Effect:** Injection in primary tumor + injection in hepatic metastasis allows assessment of whether conditioning local to primary accelerates systemic immunologic response affecting distant metastasis (abscopal effect documented but incompletely understood).

### 1.4.3. Clinical Precedents

Endoscopic injections of immunooncologic agents (anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4) in colonic tumors have demonstrated safety and abscopal potential.

Administration of oncolytic viruses via echoenodoscopy in pancreatic cancer has shown feasibility and preliminary safety.

## 1.5. Justification of Candidate Population: Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

Selection of mCRC patients with unresectable or chemotherapy-resistant disease represents a population with unmet medical need for multiple reasons:

**Dismal prognosis:** Median survival <18 months even with latest-generation systemic therapies

**Few therapeutic options:** After progression on 2-3 lines of systemic treatment

**Frequently accessible lesions:** Hepatic metastases present in >90% of metastatic progression cases, and frequently accessible to percutaneous puncture

**Opportunity for serial biopsy:** Solid tumor lesions permit sample collection through image-guided core or fine needle aspiration, facilitating mechanistic studies

**Potential for systemic immunologic benefit:** Induction of local immunologic response may translate to systemic disease control through abscopal immunity mechanisms, phenomenon well-documented with other immunooncology therapies

## 1.6. Justification for Multiple Accessible Metastatic Sites

Given that mCRC patients frequently present with multifocal metastatic disease (liver, lung, peritoneum, lymph nodes), protocol expansion to permit intratumoral injection in multiple accessible sites is fully justified:

**Pulmonary Metastases:**

- Present in ~37.5% of patients with documented hepatic metastasis
- Technically accessible to CT-guided percutaneous injection (established procedure in interventional oncology)
- Tumor microenvironment (hypoxia, stromal density, vascularization) differs from liver, permitting comparative studies of viral replication and local immunologic response
- Permits assessment of abscopal effects: pulmonary injection followed by analysis of non-injected hepatic lesions

**Mediastinal/Hilar Lymph Nodes:**

- Frequently affected in mCRC (mediastinal/hilar adenopathy in ~30-40% of patients with pulmonary metastases)
- Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critical for systemic antitumor immunologic response generation
- Technically accessible to EBUS (endobronchial ultrasound) real-time injection, with safety demonstrated in preclinical studies
- Intranodal injection permits direct "priming" of zone where adaptive immunologic response is generated

**Peritoneal Metastases/Peritoneal Carcinomatosis:**

- Present in ~10-15% of mCRC metastatic patients
- Peritoneal microenvironment favorable for viral replication and immunologic activation
- Technically accessible to simple percutaneous intraperitoneal injection
- Intraperitoneal administration allows diffuse distribution contacting multiple tumor implants simultaneously, potentially optimizing viral replication and local immune response

# 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

## 2.1. Primary Objective

Evaluate the **safety and tolerability** of rAMPV-4 administered by intratumoral injection through multiple-dose schedule (2-3 injections separated by 7 days) in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, determining:

- The **dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)** through modified 3+3 dose-escalation design

- The **maximum tolerated dose (MTD)**, defined as the dose immediately below that at which ≥33% of patients experience DLT during 28-day observation period

# 3. STUDY DESIGN

## 3.1. Type of Trial

Phase I clinical trial, open-label (unblinded), non-comparative, multicenter, with dose-escalation using modified 3+3 design and subsequent dose expansion.

*"First-in-Human, Phase I, Open-label, Multicenter, Dose-Escalation and Expansion Trial of Intratumoral rAMPV-4 in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer"*

## 3.2. Study Phases

### Phase A: Dose-Escalation (Dose-Escalation Cohorts)

- Evaluation of 4-6 staggered dose levels (Cohorts 1-6) following standard 3+3 design
- Each cohort initiates with minimum 3 patients
- Application of 3+3 design rules:
  - If 0 of 3 patients present DLT in observation window: escalate to next dose
  - If ≥1 of 3 patients present DLT: expand cohort to 6 total patients
    - If ≥2 of 6 present DLT: dose escalation stops; previous dose designated MTD
    - If ≤1 of 6 present DLT: escalate to next dose
- Automatic stop if two consecutive cohorts show DLT in ≥2 of 6 patients

> **Estimated 15-25 patients in dose-escalation phase**

**Phase B: Dose-Expansion (Dose-Expansion Cohort)**

- Following RP2D identification, expansion with minimum 6-9 additional patients at that dose
- Confirm safety and characterize exhaustive pharmacodynamics in larger cohort
- Permit exploratory analysis of antitumor activity

> **Estimated 6-9 patients in expansion phase**
>
> **Total estimated: 21-34 patients**

## 3.3. DLT Observation Period

- 28 days from first rAMPV-4 injection (Day 1 to Day 28), termed "DLT Assessment Window" or "Cycle 1".

**Justification:** This observation period is standard in clinical trials of cellular, gene, and oncolytic virus therapies, permitting complete evaluation of:

- Acute local inflammatory reaction (typically maximum 2-7 days post-injection)
- Systemic toxicity from viral shedding and immunologic response (typically maximum days 3-14)
- Recovery from transient, reversible toxicity
- Development of late complications related to injection (infection, hemorrhage)

# 4. DEFINITION OF DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITY (DLT)

## 4.1. General DLT Framework

DLT is defined as any adverse event (AE) probably or definitely related to rAMPV-4, occurring during DLT assessment period (Days 1-28) and meeting specific severity criteria described in NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 6.0.

## 4.2. DLT Criteria: Systemic Toxicity

**Non-Hematologic Toxicity:** Any toxicity CTCAE ≥Grade 3 that is not:

- Of brief, transient, self-limiting nature (e.g., isolated fever <24h, nausea controlled with antiemetics)
- Manageable with standard medical interventions without impacting dose escalation

**Hematologic Toxicity:**

- Grade 4 Leukopenia (ANC <500/μL) lasting ≥7 days
- Grade 4 Anemia (Hemoglobin <5 g/dL) requiring transfusion
- Grade 4 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000/μL) with associated hemorrhage
- Grade 3+ Coagulopathy (INR >3) unexplained by preexisting comorbidity

**Febrile Neutropenia:** Grade 3 Neutropenia (ANC 500-999/μL) + fever ≥38.0°C or with documented infection

**Serious Adverse Event (SAE):** Any probably-related SAE including:

- Prolonged hospitalization (>3 days)
- Deterioration of organ function (hepatic, renal, cardiac)
- Death
- Immediate life threat

## 4.3. DLT Criteria: Intratumoral and Site-Specific Toxicity

### Hepatic DLT:

- **Intratumoral Hemorrhage Grade ≥3:** Requiring transfusion or intervention
- **Intrahepatic Abscess:** Requiring percutaneous drainage + IV antibiotics >7 days
- **Marked AST/ALT elevation:** >5× upper limit normal (ULN) in 48h without alternative etiology

### Primary Colorectal/Rectal DLT (NEW ADDITION - OPTIONAL):

**Colonic Perforation:**

- Colonic wall perforation documented by imaging (pneumoperitoneum, contrast extravasation) OR intraoperative/endoscopic signs
- Requires urgent surgical repair OR conservative management with bowel rest/antibiotics/prolonged percutaneous drainage (>7 days)

**Intratumoral Hemorrhage:**

- Massive post-injection bleeding (hemoglobin drops >2 g/dL OR requires ≥2 unit transfusion) not resolved with standard endoscopic measures
- Hemoglobin persistently <7 g/dL requiring prolonged transfusion support

**Colonic Fistulization:**

- Formation of colonic fistula (e.g., colovesical, coloneal) requiring surgical intervention

**Perforation/Fistulization Associated with Infection:**

- Perforation or fistulization complicated with documented bacterial peritonitis (fever, elevated PCR/procalcitonin, severe abdominal symptoms) requiring prolonged IV antibiotics and/or urgent surgical intervention

**Severe Colitis/Mucositis:**

- Post-injection colonic inflammation with severe uncontrolled symptoms (>5 bowel movements/day refractory to loperamide, Grade 3 severe abdominal pain impairing daily activity, persistent rectal bleeding) lasting >7 days
- Endoscopic changes compatible with transmural colitis requiring systemic therapy (IV corticosteroids, biologics) or prolonged bowel rest

**Intestinal Obstruction:**

- **Sepsis/Septic Shock:** Related to administration

## 4.4. Expected Inflammatory Reactions (NOT DLT if Manageable)

Some events are recognized as expected and predictable inflammatory reactions following intratumoral oncolytic virus injection, and do not qualify as DLT if transient and controllable.

**Fever:**

- NOT DLT: Fever <38.5°C controlled with antipyretics
- YES DLT: Fever >39.0°C lasting >3 days or with hemodynamic compromise

**Injection Site Pain:**

- NOT DLT: Local pain Grade 1-2, manageable with analgesics
- YES DLT: Pain Grade ≥3 impairing daily function

**Transient Transaminase Elevation:**

- NOT DLT: AST/ALT 1-3× ULN (reversible in 7-14 days)
- YES DLT: AST/ALT >5× ULN acute or >3× ULN non-reversible

**Elevated Serum Cytokines:**

- NOT DLT: IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8 elevated without severe systemic symptoms
- YES DLT: Elevated cytokines + severe systemic symptoms preventing escalation

*Rationale: Oncolytic viruses by nature trigger predictable local inflammatory response; distinguishing "manageable expected inflammation" from "unacceptable true toxicity" is critical to avoid over-estimating DLT and unnecessarily halting escalation.*

- **Injection volume:** 1.5-2.5 mL per lesion per administration

## 6.2. Route of Administration and Procedure

**Route:** Intratumoral injection under direct image guidance in target lesion

**Image Guidance by Site:**

| **Location** | **Primary Modality** | **Justification** |
|---|---|---|
| Hepatic Metastasis | Real-time Ultrasound | Continuous needle monitoring with Doppler safety |
| Pulmonary Metastasis | CT Fluoroscopy or Cone-Beam CT | Reduced procedural time, lower pneumothorax risk |
| Mediastinal Lymph Node | EBUS with 21-22G needle | Superior sensitivity >90%, real-time vascular visualization |
| Peritoneal Metastases | Abdominal Ultrasound | Direct percutaneous access |

## 6.3. Dosing Schedule: Proposed Dose Levels

### Rationale for Dose Selection

Initial dose selection applied standard Phase I dose-escalation principles:

- **Preclinical Data:** NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) from animal toxicology studies
- **Allometric Conversion:** Species-standard factors (3-10×)
- **Safety Margin:** Additional multiplier for human uncertainty (1/3 to 1/10 estimated NOAEL)
- **Comparative Literature:** Initial doses from homologous oncolytic virus clinical trials

### Dose Level Table

| **Cohort** | **Dose per Injection** | **Number of Injections** | **Total Dose per Patient** | **Increment** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | 1.0 × 10¹⁰ vp | 3 | 3.0 × 10¹⁰ vp | N/A (initial) | Very conservative; comparable to low doses in literature |
| **2** | 5.0 × 10¹⁰ vp | 3 | 1.5 × 10¹¹ vp | 5× | Moderate escalation; dose-dependence evaluation |
| **3** | 1.0 × 10¹¹ vp | 3 | 3.0 × 10¹¹ vp | 2× | Pronounced escalation; established clinical range |
| **4** | 2.5 × 10¹¹ vp | 2-3 | 5.0-7.5 × 10¹¹ vp | 2.5× | Higher doses; potential reduction to 2 injections if DLT |
| **5** | 5.0 × 10¹¹ vp | 2 | 1.0 × 10¹² vp | 2× | Maximum explored; comparable to clinical comparators |

**Escalation Justification:**

- 2-5× increments between cohorts are standard in oncology, permitting efficient MTD identification
- Maintains conservatism in initial cohorts while exploring therapeutic range
- Estimated 21-34 patients allows evaluation of 5-6 dose levels with adequate statistical power

**Important Note:** These specific values (10¹⁰ to 10¹² vp) must be prospectively validated using rAMPV-4-specific preclinical data. Recommendations:

- Consultation with Sponsor and Data Safety Monitoring Board prior to trial initiation
- Documentation in Investigator's Brochure of dose initial justification
- Protocol amendment possibility if additional preclinical data available

## 6.4. Temporal Administration Schedule (Multiple-Dose Regimen)

**Standard Regimen: 3 Weekly Injections**

| **Study Day** | **Event** | **Procedure** |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | First Injection (Dose 1) | Intratumoral injection lesion 1 (±lesion 2 if multifocal) |
| Day 2-3 | Post-injection Observation | Clinical follow-up (telephone contact if no complications) |
| Day 7 | Pre-Dose 2 Evaluation | CBC, Chemistry, Clinical evaluation; **BIOPSY INJECTED LESION** |
| Day 8 | Second Injection (Dose 2) | Re-injection original lesion or 2nd site if multifocal |
| Day 14 | Post-Dose 2 Evaluation | CBC, Chemistry, clinical contact |
| Day 15 | Third Injection (Dose 3) | Re-injection if DLT not contraindicated |
| Day 21 | Post-Dose 3 Evaluation | CBC, Chemistry, clinical evaluation |
| Day 28 | End Cycle 1 / DLT Assessment Window Close | CBC, Chemistry, imaging (MRI/CT), **FINAL BIOPSY**, plasma viral PCR, NAb |

**Alternative Regimen: 2 Biweekly Injections (if DLT after 3rd dose)**

If Cohort N data show that 3 weekly injections generate unacceptable DLT, schedule may be modified to:

| **Study Day** | **Event** |
|---|---|
| Day 1 | Dose 1 Injection |
| Day 14 | Dose 2 Injection |
| Day 28 | DLT Assessment Window Close; Final Biopsy; Evaluations |

## 6.5. Within-Patient Dose Modifications

**Post-Administration Dose Reduction**

If patient experiences severe local toxicity post-Dose 1 or 2 that completely resolves in 5-7 days (e.g., Grade 2 intratumoral hemorrhage resolved, severe pain responding to analgesics), within-patient dose reduction for subsequent administrations (typically 25-50% reduction) may be considered with:

- Explicit Sponsor approval
- Institutional Review Board approval
- Patient informed consent
- Detailed documentation

**Within-Patient Discontinuation**

rAMPV-4 is discontinued if:

- DLT develops during observation window (patient continues safety follow-up without further dosing)
- Severe radiologic disease progression (>25% increase sum of longest diameters)
- Severe probably-related AE requiring prolonged hospitalization or life-threatening
- Informed consent withdrawal
- Loss to follow-up or persistent protocol non-compliance
