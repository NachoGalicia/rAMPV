# COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY: EFFICACY OF PROGESTERONE IN PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME

## INFORMATION BASED ON REGULAR CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION

### Definition and Clinical Characteristics

Premenstrual syndrome constitutes a disorder characterized by nervousness, emotional instability, anxiety, depression and possible headaches, edema and mastalgia occurring during the 7-10 days preceding menstruation, typically resolving within a few hours after the onset of menstrual flow. The symptomatology appears to be related to fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle[13].

### Pathophysiological Bases of Progestin Therapy

The predominant theory in medical literature sustains that premenstrual syndrome results from an estrogen-progesterone imbalance. The role of progesterone in regulating psychological and physical symptoms during the menstrual cycle has been extensively documented in multiple clinical investigations[7][13]. The administration of progesterone may help modulate these hormonal changes and, consequently, alleviate associated symptomatology.

### Clinical Evidence of Efficacy

#### Dennerstein et al. Study (British Medical Journal, 1985)

The most relevant study for the indication of premenstrual syndrome is the one conducted by Dennerstein and collaborators, which constituted a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial comparing oral micronized progesterone (300 mg/day for 2 months) with placebo (2 months) in 23 women prospectively selected with confirmed premenstrual syndrome[7].

**Selection Criteria:**
- Mood disturbances and physical alterations in the 7-10 days preceding menstruation
- Symptoms of sufficient intensity to incapacitate occupational or relational activities
- Relief of symptoms within 3 days of menstrual onset, with symptom-free phase of minimum one week
- Regular menstruations with regular symptom appearance during preceding 6 cycles[7]

**Multiparametric Evaluation:**
- Moos menstrual distress questionnaire
- Beck depression inventory
- Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory
- Checklist of adjectives related to mood
- Daily symptom record with 1-5 scale (absence to considerable)[7]

**Main Findings:**

Analysis of variance revealed an overall beneficial effect of progesterone on all evaluated variables, except restlessness, positive moods and sexual interest[7]. Maximum improvement was recorded during the first month of progesterone treatment[7].

Specifically, in discriminant analysis after only one month of treatment, patients treated with progesterone could be clearly distinguished from those receiving placebo in relation to measurements of:
- Stress (p<0.05)
- State anxiety
- Overall mood
- With 85% correct classification (Rc=0.79; p<0.002)[7]

**Responsive Symptoms:**

Symptoms that showed significant response to progesterone versus placebo included:

- **Negative affect:** Reduction from 23.22 (placebo) to 17.83 (progesterone); p<0.05[7]
- **Water retention:** Reduction from 10.70 to 8.78; p<0.05[7]
- **Abdominal, hands and legs swelling:** Reduction from 2.60 to 2.01; p<0.01[7]
- **Depression:** Reduction from 2.19 to 1.74; p<0.05[7]
- **Control (generalized anxiety):** Reduction from 10.89 to 8.22; p<0.02[7]
- **Behavioral change:** Improvement with favorable direction (p=1.83)[7]

**Non-Responsive Symptoms:**

The only premenstrual symptoms that did not respond consistently favorably to progesterone were:
- Restlessness/vigilance (menstrual distress questionnaire)
- Sexual thoughts and interest (daily symptom record)[7]

**Temporal Pattern of Response:**

The most significant improvement occurred during the first month of progesterone treatment, with maintenance of appreciable effects during months 2-4[7]. After 1-2 months of treatment, an appreciably more beneficial effect of progesterone than placebo could be identified on mood and some physical symptoms[7].

**Analysis of Responders:**

Twelve women responded clearly to progesterone according to both parameters (daily symptom record and menstrual distress questionnaire), whereas 4 responded clearly to placebo[7], suggesting heterogeneity in therapeutic response.

### Effects on Biochemical Parameters

In relation to underlying pathophysiology, a study conducted by de Lignières and Vincens in 56 postmenopausal women demonstrated that when estradiol levels were elevated and oral progesterone was added (300 mg/day for 10 days), an "agreeable tranquilizing effect" was observed with almost complete disappearance of aggressiveness and anxiety, accompanied by sleep improvement[4]. This finding suggests that the psychological efficacy of progesterone depends on simultaneous estrogenic context.

### Clinical Results in Individual Cases

The review of clinical cases from the SEID Expert Report (2002) documents multiple cases of premenstrual syndrome treated with oral Utrogestan:

**Case ROC (43 years old, premenstrual syndrome with bilateral mastalgia):**
- Presentation: Premenstrual anxiety, bilateral mastalgia 8 days/month, irregular cycles 21-25 days, prior neurotic tendency
- Treatment: 3 capsules/day progesterone (300 mg) between days 17-27, then adjusted to 2 capsules (200 mg) days 18-28
- Result: Mastalgia disappeared, psychological balance recovered, marked anxiety reduction, cycles regularized[13]

**Case MER (33-34 years old, premenstrual syndrome with character problems):**
- Presentation: Anovulation, confirmed luteal insufficiency, premenstrual syndrome with character problems for 8 days before menstruation, mastalgia
- Treatment: 2 capsules/day (200 mg) between days 16-25 of cycle
- Result: Complete disappearance of premenstrual syndrome[13]

**Case REM (50 years old, premenopausal premenstrual syndrome):**
- Presentation: Long cycles (40 days), premenstrual syndrome 8 days, character disturbances, mastalgia, depression, seborrhea
- Treatment: 2 capsules/day (200 mg) between days 16-25 of cycle
- Result: Normalized cycles, complete disappearance of premenstrual syndrome, seborrhea reduction[13]

### Mechanism of Action: Psychoactive Metabolites

An important neurochemical finding is that oral administration of micronized progesterone not only increases plasma progesterone concentrations, but also increases levels of metabolites known to act directly on GABA receptors in the central nervous system, particularly 5β-pregnanolone (reduced pregnanolone)[13]. These metabolites may explain both psychological side effects (drowsiness) and potentially therapeutic benefits in mood disorders. However, vaginal administration produces only minor changes in these psychotropic metabolites, suggesting a partially distinct mechanism of action[13].

### Tolerance Profile

Data indicate that at moderate doses (200-300 mg/day administered as single nightly dose), oral progesterone presents acceptable tolerance. In the Dennerstein study, side effects were similar to those observed with placebo when administered as a single nightly dose in women with adequate estrogen levels[7]. Drowsiness, when occurring, typically appears 1-3 hours post-ingestion and can be minimized by preferentially administering the dose at bedtime[13].

## COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF EVIDENTIAL SUFFICIENCY

### Strengths of Available Evidence

1. **Robust methodological design:** The Dennerstein study constitutes a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, representing the gold standard of clinical research[7]

2. **Prospective population selection:** Strict inclusion criteria ensure that only women with authentic premenstrual syndrome were recruited, avoiding overdiagnosis bias[7]

3. **Multiparametric evaluation:** Use of multiple validated scales (Moos, Beck, Spielberger) and daily symptom record provides methodological triangulation[7]

4. **Analysis of responders:** Identification that 52% of patients responded clearly while 17% responded to placebo reflects clinical realism[7]

5. **Confirmation in multiple clinical contexts:** Documentation of effects in individual cases, international studies (France, Belgium) and pharmacovigilance data[13]

6. **Specificity of responsive symptoms:** Clear determination of which symptoms respond (negative affect, water retention, swelling, depression, anxiety) versus which do not (restlessness, libido) provides construct validity[7]

### Significant Limitations of Available Evidence

1. **Modest sample size:** 23 participants in the pivotal study is small for generalization, although typical for the publication era (1985)[7]

2. **Limited duration:** 4 months of total treatment (2 months with progesterone, 2 with placebo) does not allow assessment of long-term efficacy or possible chronic side effects[7]

3. **Absence of systematic dose-response data:** Although 300 mg/day was used, there is no systematic comparison with other doses (100-200 mg/day) specifically in premenstrual syndrome[7]

4. **Uncharacterized population heterogeneity:** Not specified whether premenstrual syndrome variants (somatic vs psychological predominance) respond differentially[7]

5. **Lack of comparison with alternative pharmacological agents:** No direct comparative data against SSRIs, aldosterone antagonists, or other established treatments for premenstrual syndrome[7]

6. **Differences between routes of administration:** Most detailed clinical cases in Spanish registration used oral route, but less documentation exists for vaginal route in pure premenstrual syndrome (vs. assisted reproduction)[13]

## FINAL ASSESSMENT FOR EFFICACY ACCREDITATION

**ARE THESE DATA SUFFICIENT TO ACCREDIT EFFICACY IN PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME?**

### Response Nuanced by Regulatory Context

**IN EUROPEAN CONTEXT (2002): YES, WITH RESTRICTIONS**

Data were sufficient for:
- **Spanish regulatory approval (2002):** The SEID Expert Document includes premenstrual syndrome as approved therapeutic indication based on this evidence[13]
- **Inclusion in product information:** Specified as indication for oral route together with other indications for progesterone insufficiency[13]
- **Multinational consistency:** Prior approval in France and documented extended use suggest comparative regulatory acceptance[13]

**Applicable regulatory standard:** In 2002, the European Medicines Agency accepted for natural hormones such as progesterone a less restrictive evidential standard than for synthetic novel molecules. A pivotal randomized, double-blind clinical trial with multiparametric evaluation in prospectively selected population, supplemented with documented clinical experience, met criteria for "clinically relevant benefit demonstrated."

### IN CURRENT SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT (2026)

**INSUFFICIENT FOR CHANGES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE**

By contemporary standards of evidence-based medicine:

1. **Single cohort of 23 patients:** Although a randomized study, a single population and one investigator/center limits generalizability capacity. Replication in multiple independent centers was required.

2. **Lack of pharmacokinetic data in premenstrual syndrome:** Unlike reproductive indications where complete characterization of plasma, endometrial and receptor levels exists, kinetic evidence in premenstrual syndrome is inferred[13].

3. **Absence of demonstrative mechanism:** Without measurements of progesterone receptor expression in endometrium, BDNF, cerebrospinal fluid serotonin or other biomarkers, the mechanism remains speculative[13].

4. **Weak comparators:** Placebo is an appropriate comparator but does not allow assessment of relative position versus SSRIs (2026 standard), aldosterone antagonists, or cognitive-behavioral therapies that have emerged as validated alternatives.

## PROFESSIONAL CONCLUSION

**Currently available data ARE SUFFICIENT for:**
- Justifying supervised clinical use in selected population (premenstrual syndrome with documented luteal insufficiency)
- Considering it as complementary therapeutic option in contexts where SSRIs contraindicate
- Maintaining regulatory approval in jurisdictions that already granted it (Spain, France)

**Data ARE INSUFFICIENT for:**
- Redesignation as first-line treatment against superior evidence for SSRIs
- Extrapolation to mild forms of premenstrual syndrome without luteal deficiency
- Replacement of established therapeutic standards without additional replication

**Key evidential gap:** A large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing progesterone vs SSRI vs control in moderate-severe premenstrual syndrome is required, with characterization of pharmacokinetics, neuroendocrine parameters and cerebral biomarkers to update position in contemporary practice.
