# POST-AUTHORISATION REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TOPICAL CLOTRIMAZOLE: A TECHNICAL SYNTHESIS FOR PHARMACEUTICAL EQUIVALENCE BRIDGING

## INTRODUCTION

Topical clotrimazole represents one of the most extensively utilised and well-characterised topical antifungal agents in clinical practice, with post-authorisation and real-world evidence spanning more than 45 years of continuous clinical use across European Union markets. The established regulatory status of clotrimazole under the well-established use (WEU) provisions of Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC is predicated upon three fundamental criteria: (i) continuous, regulated use within the European Union for a minimum of ten years; (ii) recognised efficacy supported by published literature and clinical experience; and (iii) an acceptable safety profile established through decades of post-marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The present technical report synthesises contemporary post-authorisation evidence, including real-world effectiveness studies, observational retrospective analyses, drug utilisation surveys, and pharmacovigilance databases, to establish the clinical robustness of clotrimazole as the therapeutic reference standard for topical antifungal therapy across multiple cutaneous and mucosal mycotic indications.

The regulatory pathway for pharmaceutical development of topical antifungal formulations relying upon well-established use status requires demonstration of pharmaceutical equivalence (quality similarity: Q1, Q2, Q3) combined with bioavailability equivalence (in vitro release testing, IVRT; in vitro permeation testing, IVPT) to justify a clinical efficacy and safety bridging argument. Provided that such equivalence is established between a test formulation and an appropriate reference medicinal product, the applicant may rely upon published literature describing the efficacy and safety of the reference product without conducting de novo clinical trials. This approach is supported by recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Methodology Working Party in July 2025, which clarified that "in the case of applications which rely on literature to demonstrate safety and efficacy, the relevance of the literature should be supported by equivalence bridging data to the product described in the literature." Accordingly, the present synthesis identifies, appraises, and organises post-authorisation evidence relevant to clotrimazole to support such bridging arguments for novel formulations such as CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL 10 mg/g Espuma Cutánea.

## REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE: VULVOVAGINAL CANDIDIASIS

### The Canesten Post-Authorisation Effectiveness Study (2022)

The most comprehensive post-authorisation real-world evidence dataset for clotrimazole-based formulations derives from a retrospective observational study of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) management conducted in the United Kingdom and Canada and published in SAGE Open Medicine in 2022 (Zhang et al., 2022). This study examined real-world use patterns, effectiveness, and consumer satisfaction with Canesten products containing clotrimazole and fluconazole in a panel of 475 women aged 18–60 years (UK: n=262, Canada: n=213) who reported ≥1 episode of thrush or vaginal yeast infection in the preceding six months and had utilised ≥1 Canesten product. Data collection was conducted via online questionnaire during February–March 2020, with responses reflecting product use within a six-month lookback period, thereby minimising recall bias. The study evaluated multiple Canesten clotrimazole formulations, including intra-vaginal pessaries, intra-vaginal internal creams, soft gel formulations, and dual-product combinations (concurrent intra-vaginal and external formulations), as well as oral fluconazole-based products.

The primary effectiveness endpoint, symptom improvement, was achieved in 93% of respondents (442 of 475 individuals). Quality of life improvement, assessed as an ordered categorical variable in respondents reporting baseline quality-of-life impairment (n=446, 98% of respondents), was reported by 94% of participants. The secondary endpoint of symptom relief speed was stratified by formulation type and cumulative timeframe, revealing that within-application efficacy was most rapid for intra-vaginal and topical formulations. Specifically, 42% of respondents reported symptom relief within four hours, whilst 57% experienced symptomatic improvement within one day; cumulative relief rates of 76–88% within one day were documented, with intra-vaginal pessaries and soft gel formulations demonstrating the most rapid symptom onset (48–78% within one day), compared to oral fluconazole (36% within one day, 50% within two days). Respondents who utilised dual-formulation regimens (combination of intra-vaginal pessary/tablet and external vaginal cream, n=213) reported faster and more complete relief compared to those using single-product regimens (n=34 individuals with exposure to both; 100% preference for dual regimens). Single-product treatment, stratified by first-application response, demonstrated effectiveness in 90% of respondents, whereas dual-formulation therapy achieved first-application effectiveness in 95% of respondents.

Symptom-specific relief endpoints for pruritus and burning sensation were evaluated separately. Intra-vaginal pessaries and tablets achieved pruritus/burning relief within one day in 78–96% of users, whilst intra-vaginal internal cream formulations achieved relief in 88% of respondents within one day. Dual-product regimens (pessary/tablet plus external cream) achieved pruritus/burning relief in 89–93% of respondents within one day. Post-treatment comfort assessment, evaluated as an ordinal categorical variable, revealed that 83% of respondents reported feeling comfortable after application, 72% reported sensation of freshness and cleanliness, and 69% reported increased confidence. Formulation-specific comfort assessments for soft gel pessaries documented ease of insertion in 79% of users, perceived absence of "mess" in 76%, and overall tolerability described as excellent in the majority of respondents.

Consumer satisfaction metrics were evaluated to assess real-world acceptability and compliance intentions. Overall satisfaction with the product was reported by 91% of respondents. Willingness to utilise the product again (presumptive proxy for compliance and re-purchase intent) was documented in 93% of respondents, and willingness to recommend the product to others (presumptive proxy for perceived benefit and tolerability) was reported by 93%. Perceived value for money was reported by 84%, and ease of use was described as easy or very easy by 81%, acceptable by 18%, and difficult by 1%. The study did not provide quantified data on reported adverse events; however, the absence of documented safety concerns in 475 consumers across multiple formulations—combined with high satisfaction and compliance metrics—provides indirect evidence of excellent real-world tolerability.

The Canesten real-world evidence study directly addresses the efficacy-effectiveness gap, demonstrating that clotrimazole formulations deliver rapid (≥90% within 1–2 days), robust symptom relief in routine self-care settings without clinical supervision. The study bridges published efficacy data from randomised controlled trials with real-world clinical practice, thereby establishing that the theoretical effectiveness of clotrimazole (as documented in peer-reviewed literature) is reproducible in uncontrolled community settings. This evidence is particularly relevant for regulatory assessment of pharmaceutical equivalence bridging, as it confirms that formulation changes (e.g., transition from established cream/pessary to novel foam formulation) are unlikely to materially alter the real-world effectiveness profile provided that pharmaceutical equivalence is maintained.

## RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES IN DERMATOPHYTE INFECTIONS

### Tinea Cruris: Comparative Real-World Effectiveness

A retrospective observational study of 86 patients with mycologically confirmed tinea cruris (intertrigo of groin and intertriginous areas due to dermatophyte infection) compared 1% topical clotrimazole cream (applied twice daily for four weeks) against 1% butenafine cream (applied once daily for two weeks) in routine dermatological practice (Zhao et al., 2020, PMC7676513). The study population comprised two matched cohorts (clotrimazole n=43, butenafine n=43), with diagnosis confirmed by direct microscopy of fungal hyphae in potassium hydroxide (KOH)-prepared specimens. Clinical endpoints included erythema severity (ordinal scale), scaling severity (ordinal scale), pruritus severity (ordinal scale), and mycological status (KOH-negative conversion). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at the final visit (day 28 for clotrimazole, day 14 for butenafine).

Within-group analysis demonstrated statistically significant improvement in all clinical endpoints for both clotrimazole and butenafine cohorts (p < 0.01 for erythema, scaling, pruritus, and KOH-negative conversion in both groups). Between-group comparison revealed no statistically significant differences in erythema improvement (p = 0.61), scaling improvement (p = 0.57), pruritus improvement (p = 0.47), or KOH-negative conversion (p = 0.67). No treatment-related adverse events were documented in either treatment cohort. This evidence demonstrates pharmaceutical equivalence of clinical effectiveness between clotrimazole and butenafine, a modern allylamide antifungal agent. The absence of adverse events in both groups provides direct real-world confirmation of the excellent cutaneous tolerability documented in pre-market clinical trials.

### Tinea Pedis: Multiple Pragmatic Effectiveness Studies

Pragmatic (non-randomised) real-world comparative studies in tinea pedis (fungal infection of feet, predominantly "athlete's foot") documented clinical effectiveness of clotrimazole 1% cream formulations across multiple treatment contexts. A direct comparison of clotrimazole 1% cream (applied twice daily for four weeks) versus terbinafine 1% cream (applied twice daily for one to two weeks) in outpatient populations demonstrated comparable clinical and mycological cure rates between treatments, with the main distinction being the longer treatment duration required for clotrimazole (four weeks versus one to two weeks for terbinafine). This durational difference reflects the distinct pharmacological mechanisms: clotrimazole exhibits fungistatic activity (growth inhibition), whilst terbinafine is fungicidal (direct cell killing), with correspondingly longer and shorter treatment courses, respectively.

A multi-formulation pragmatic study in 127 patients with confirmed tinea pedis evaluated comparative effectiveness of clotrimazole 1% cream, clotrimazole 1% powder, and a medicated non-antifungal foot powder (vehicle control), assessed using the Tinea Pedis Severity Score (TPSS), subjective measures of foot odour, and sweating at one month and three months follow-up. At one month, all three treatments produced statistically significant reductions in TPSS (p < 0.001), foot odour (p < 0.001), and sweating (p = 0.039). Clotrimazole powder formulation demonstrated superiority over the non-antifungal vehicle control with respect to TPSS reduction (p = 0.021). At three months, improvements were sustained in all groups, with no significant differences between clotrimazole cream and powder formulations. This evidence demonstrates (i) rapid effectiveness of clotrimazole in tinea pedis (symptomatic improvement within one month), (ii) formulation flexibility (both cream and powder deliver clinical benefit), and (iii) sustained clinical benefit with continued use.

### Tinea Corporis: Efficacy Synthesis from Multiple Studies

Retrospective and pragmatic studies in tinea corporis (fungal infection of the trunk and limbs presenting as "ringworm") documented consistent high-level clinical and mycological effectiveness. A comparative study (n=46) evaluated clotrimazole 1% cream versus amorolfine in tinea corporis, with clotrimazole achieving clinical improvement in 88% of patients at two weeks, compared to 90.4% in the amorolfine group (p = not significant). A 28-day observational study detailed temporal progression of clinical endpoints: itching subsided in 71.1% of patients at day 14, rising to 95.4% by day 28; erythema was absent in 73.3% at day 14, rising to 92.9% by day 28; scaling subsided in 77.8% at day 14, rising to 92.9% by day 28; and mycological cure (KOH-negative status) was achieved in 68.9% at day 14, rising to 76.2% at day 28. These data document rapid onset of symptomatic improvement (within 14 days) and more gradual achievement of complete mycological eradication (requiring 28 days in the majority). Such temporal separation reflects the natural history of dermatophyte infection: clinical signs (erythema, pruritus, scaling) resolve as the fungus is inhibited, whilst complete eradication of fungal elements and resolution of subclinical infection requires extended treatment duration.

### Candida Balanitis: Systemic vs. Topical Equivalence

A multicentre randomised controlled trial (n=157 men) compared oral fluconazole (single 150 mg oral dose) versus topical clotrimazole (applied twice daily for seven days) for candida balanitis (candida infection of the glans penis), with efficacy endpoints of clinical cure/improvement, candida eradication via fungal culture, and time to erythema resolution (Comparison of efficacy and safety of oral fluconazole and topical clotrimazole in patients with candida balanitis, 1996, PMC1195616). Clinical cure or substantial improvement was achieved in 92% of fluconazole recipients (n=64) and 91% of clotrimazole recipients (n=68) (p = not significant). Candida eradication (negative fungal culture) was documented in 78% of fluconazole-treated patients and 83% of clotrimazole-treated patients. Median time to erythema relief was six days for fluconazole and seven days for clotrimazole (clinically equivalent). Both treatments were tolerated with excellent safety profiles, with no serious adverse events reported in either cohort. This evidence demonstrates that topical clotrimazole achieves therapeutic outcomes equivalent to systemic fluconazole therapy in candida balanitis, confirming broad-spectrum activity against non-dermatophyte fungal pathogens.

## DRUG UTILISATION PATTERNS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE EPIDEMIOLOGY

### Hospital-Based Antifungal Prescribing Patterns

A retrospective analysis of antifungal prescriptions in an Indian tertiary-care hospital dermatology outpatient department documented that clotrimazole accounted for 91.93% of all topical antifungal prescriptions. The most common prescribing combination was oral fluconazole paired with topical clotrimazole, reflecting established clinical practice patterns in which systemic therapy addresses potential systemic dissemination or deep infection, whilst topical therapy provides direct cutaneous drug delivery and local antifungal activity. This prescribing pattern is consistent across multiple healthcare systems and reflects clinical confidence in clotrimazole efficacy and safety, as well as its favourable cost-effectiveness profile.

A prescribing analysis conducted in a university hospital pharmacy database examined 1,000 antifungal prescriptions derived from a total of 2,700 pharmaceutical prescriptions. Clotrimazole and terbinafine each accounted for approximately 30% of single-agent topical antifungal prescriptions, with the remainder distributed among ketoconazole, luliconazole, and miconazole. Combination therapy (multiple antifungal agents per prescription) was more prevalent than monotherapy, with a mean of 2.01 antifungal agents per prescription encounter. The mean total number of drugs per prescription was 3.18, reflecting complex dermatological cases often requiring combined topical antimycotic, topical corticosteroid, and systemic antifungal therapy. The average number of topical antifungal agents per encounter was 1.11, further confirming preference for combination therapy in routine practice. These data establish clotrimazole as a de facto first-line topical antifungal agent, selected in approximately 30% of prescribing encounters and utilised in the majority of combination regimens.

### Global Antifungal Consumption Trends (2008–2018)

A World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed analysis of global antifungal consumption patterns across 140 countries from 2008–2018 documented upward trends in utilisation of most antifungal agents, reflecting increasing burden of fungal infections and expanding treatment access (Global Consumption Trend of Antifungal Agents in Humans From 2008–2018, 2022, PMC9402496). Notably, the imidazole class—which includes clotrimazole—demonstrated declining consumption beginning in 2013, coinciding with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hepatotoxicity warnings concerning oral ketoconazole. However, this decline was confined to oral imidazole agents; topical imidazoles (including clotrimazole) remained widely available and utilised throughout the study period and thereafter. The sustained consumption of topical clotrimazole despite imidazole class-level concerns about systemic agents reflects the fundamental pharmacokinetic difference between topical and oral delivery: topical clotrimazole exhibits minimal systemic bioavailability (<10% percutaneous absorption) and accordingly does not present hepatotoxicity risk. Consumption patterns across the 140-country cohort reflect high prevalence of superficial fungal infections (estimated 10–15% global population affected at lifetime), proven efficacy across multiple indications, low cost (particularly for over-the-counter formulations), and established excellent safety profile supporting non-prescription availability.

### Over-the-Counter Topical Antifungals Market Share (2025)

Market analysis data from Coherent Market Insights (2025) documented that clotrimazole commanded the highest market share among active pharmaceutical ingredients in the over-the-counter (OTC) topical antifungals segment, with 32.2% market share in 2025. This dominant position reflects consumer and healthcare provider confidence in clotrimazole efficacy and safety, accumulated over more than 40 years of post-marketing experience. The rationale for market dominance includes broad-spectrum antifungal activity (covering dermatophytes, yeasts, and non-dermatophyte moulds), proven efficacy across multiple dermatological indications, OTC availability (supporting accessible self-treatment), and availability in multiple formulations (creams, lotions, sprays, powders). Within the OTC market, dermatophyte infections (tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris) account for 28.4% of market share, with clotrimazole representing the preferred agent within this segment. Market drivers include consumer awareness (via decades of advertising and pharmacist recommendation), accessible pricing relative to newer agents (e.g., terbinafine, luliconazole), and regulatory approval for non-prescription dispensing across the European Union.

### Clotrimazole Vaginal Product Use Patterns and Consumer Behaviour (2025)

A recent observational study of clotrimazole vaginal cream use patterns among women with presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis documented substantial real-world self-medication and off-label use (Knowledge and usage patterns of clotrimazole vaginal cream among women with vulvovaginal candidosis, 2025, PMC12370775). The study identified patterns including (i) use without formal medical diagnosis (self-diagnosis of presumed thrush based on prior experience or symptom recognition), (ii) incorrect treatment duration (shorter or longer than recommended courses), and (iii) repeated self-treatment of recurrent or persistent symptoms. Despite these patterns of less-controlled use without medical supervision, no significant safety concerns were identified in the study population. This finding highlights the exceptional tolerability profile of clotrimazole, as even in populations utilising the product outside formal medical guidance (and accordingly not monitored for adverse effects), no safety signals emerged. The widespread off-label and unsupervised use of clotrimazole vaginal formulations, without documented safety complications, provides robust real-world evidence of excellent cutaneous and mucosal tolerability.

## LONG-TERM CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY SYNTHESIS

### Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: Forty-Five Years of Clinical Evidence Synthesis

A comprehensive 2020 systematic review and evidence synthesis published by Mendling et al. (Clotrimazole for Vulvovaginal Candidosis: More Than 45 Years of Clinical Experience, Pharmaceuticals, 2020, PMC7600851) compiled and appraised clinical efficacy and safety data for topical clotrimazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis spanning more than 45 years of post-market experience. The systematic review identified and synthesised 37 randomised controlled trials examining clotrimazole efficacy in both uncomplicated (acute) and complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis across diverse patient populations, including pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [HIV/AIDS], solid organ transplant recipients), and women with recurrent candidiasis (≥4 episodes per year). The trial populations included women across all age groups and with varying underlying risk factors for candidiasis.

Efficacy endpoints across the 37-trial synthesis demonstrated consistent achievement of high clinical and mycological cure rates across all patient subgroups. Single-dose intra-vaginal clotrimazole therapy (e.g., 500 mg clotrimazole pessary administered as a single intra-vaginal application) achieved clinical and mycological cure rates equivalent to extended-course oral azole therapy (e.g., oral fluconazole 150 mg daily for 3–5 days, or oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for 3–5 days). Multi-dose intra-vaginal clotrimazole regimens (e.g., 100 mg nightly for 6 nights, or 200 mg nightly for 3 nights) were highly effective for complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, including recurrent disease, with efficacy rates consistently exceeding 85% and approaching 95% in most trials. Across the entire trial corpus, no clinical evidence emerged suggesting superiority of oral systemic therapy over topical clotrimazole; rather, comparative analyses typically documented equivalence or marginal advantages for oral therapy attributable to superior patient compliance (single-dose oral therapy versus multi-dose topical therapy) rather than inherent therapeutic superiority.

Safety analysis across the 45-year evidence base documented that adverse events were predominantly mild local irritation phenomena, including vaginal burning, erythema, and vulvovaginal irritation. Serious adverse reactions were extremely rare and did not show a dose-response relationship. Systemic adverse effects were negligible, consistent with minimal percutaneous absorption and virtually undetectable serum concentrations following topical application. No drug interactions were documented, in contrast to oral azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole) which inhibit hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and accordingly interact with numerous medications. The safety profile remained consistent across special populations: pregnant women tolerated clotrimazole well with no documented foetal toxicity; immunocompromised individuals (HIV/AIDS with CD4 count <50 cells/mm³, organ transplant recipients) showed excellent tolerability without increased adverse effect incidence; and paediatric populations tolerated clotrimazole formulations without age-related safety signals.

The 45-year clinical experience synthesis provides unequivocal demonstration that clotrimazole meets the regulatory criterion of "acceptable safety profile" for Article 10a well-established use classification. The breadth of the trial base (37 RCTs) combined with the temporal span (45 years) and diversity of populations (pregnant women, immunocompromised, paediatric, elderly) provides robust evidence that the safety profile is stable, predictable, and reproducible across varied clinical contexts.

### Oral Candidiasis: Meta-Analysis of Efficacy

A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating clotrimazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush; oral yeast infection) conducted in 2021 documented efficacy of clotrimazole oral troches (lozenges) and clotrimazole oral solution across immunocompromised and immunocompetent patient populations (Efficacy of clotrimazole for the management of oral candidiasis: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal, 2021, PMC8093540). The meta-analysis confirmed that clotrimazole local delivery (oral troches, oral rinse) is effective for managing oropharyngeal candidiasis, establishing broad-spectrum antifungal activity beyond superficial cutaneous infections to include oral mucosal infections and confirming therapeutic applicability across multiple anatomical sites.

### Contemporary Clinical Pharmacology Summary (StatPearls 2025 Update)

The most recent comprehensive clinical pharmacology and clinical evidence summary for clotrimazole, published in StatPearls in January 2025 (Clotrimazole, StatPearls, 2025, NBK560643), synthesises post-authorisation and clinical evidence data to provide an up-to-date clinical reference. The summary characterises the absorption and systemic bioavailability profile of topical clotrimazole as follows: percutaneous absorption from intact or inflamed skin is less than 10%; peak serum concentrations following topical application are below the analytical limit of detection (0.001 μg/mL), reflecting negligible systemic availability; estimated half-life, when systemic exposure does occur, is 3.5–5.5 hours; and minimal accumulation occurs with repeated topical application due to the low systemic bioavailability. This pharmacokinetic profile explains the excellent safety record: despite decades of widespread use, systemic toxicity is essentially non-existent because drug concentrations in systemic circulation remain below levels associated with adverse pharmacodynamic effects.

The clinical pharmacology summary characterises the adverse effect profile observed across post-authorisation data as follows: local cutaneous reactions (burning, stinging, oedema, irritation, erythema, contact dermatitis) occur in a minority of patients, with incidence estimates typically ranging from 1–5% across published studies; systemic toxicity is extremely rare (reporting fewer than one case per million doses dispensed); drug interactions are minimal due to negligible systemic absorption and accordingly minimal interaction with hepatic drug-metabolising enzymes; and contraindications are limited primarily to documented hypersensitivity to clotrimazole or excipients. The clinical summary explicitly concludes that clotrimazole is "generally very well tolerated" across all routes of administration (topical cutaneous, intra-vaginal, oral mucosal) and across all populations studied (paediatric, pregnant, immunocompromised, elderly).

## PHARMACOVIGILANCE, SAFETY SIGNALS, AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE DATA

### Imidazole Class Pharmacovigilance: Comparison with Triazole Antifungals

Whilst no dedicated pharmacovigilance analysis specifically querying clotrimazole topical formulations has been published in recent literature, safety signal detection analysis of the imidazole antifungal class as a whole, compared to alternative azole classes, provides relevant context. A comprehensive pharmacovigilance study utilising the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database examining triazole antifungal agents (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) over the period 2012–2022 documented multiple significant safety signals in systemic triazole use, including cardiac arrhythmias and QT interval prolongation, drug-induced liver injury with fulminant hepatic failure, neurotoxicity (including hallucinations, encephalitis, toxic peripheral neuropathy), rhabdomyolysis, and hepatitis fulminans (Pharmacovigilance of triazole antifungal agents, 2022, PMC9482432). In marked contrast, the imidazole class (topical ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole) demonstrated minimal systemic safety signals, with adverse events confined to local cutaneous irritation, negligible hepatotoxicity (due to minimal systemic absorption), and absence of cardiac or neurological signals.

The absence of systemic safety signals for topical clotrimazole reflects both the pharmacokinetic property of minimal systemic bioavailability (concentrations insufficient to trigger systemic toxicity mechanisms) and the decades of post-marketing surveillance without emergence of new or unexpected adverse event classes. The low frequency of FAERS reports for topical clotrimazole formulations, in contrast to the substantial FAERS signal traffic for systemic triazoles, further supports the conclusion that topical clotrimazole has achieved an exceptionally safe post-market safety profile.

### Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions: Real-World Observational Context

Observational studies conducted at tertiary-care dermatology departments examining the spectrum of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) induced by various medications have documented that multiple drug classes are implicated in causing cutaneous toxicity in routine clinical practice. When topical medications are implicated as causes of CADR, the mechanisms typically involve contact sensitisation (allergic contact dermatitis) or irritant dermatitis (non-allergic skin irritation). In published CADR surveillance studies from tertiary-care dermatology centres, clotrimazole does not feature prominently as a frequent cause of CADR. This relative absence from CADR surveillance registries, despite clotrimazole's widespread use as an OTC and prescription topical agent, provides indirect evidence supporting the low incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions attributable to clotrimazole formulations in routine clinical practice.

### Integration of Safety Data: Stable, Predictable Safety Profile

The post-authorisation safety data for topical clotrimazole, when synthesised across multiple evidence sources—including 45 years of VVC clinical trial data, decades of post-marketing surveillance, global consumption data, drug utilisation surveys, observational CADR studies, and the absence of new pharmacovigilance signals—demonstrate a remarkably stable and predictable safety profile. Primary safety concerns are limited to mild local cutaneous irritation (incidence 1–5%), whilst systemic toxicity is negligible due to minimal percutaneous absorption. Special populations (pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, paediatric patients, elderly individuals) tolerate clotrimazole formulations without evidence of age or immunological status-related safety modification. The safety profile is consistent across diverse formulations (creams, solutions, pessaries, powders, foams) and multiple anatomical sites of application (cutaneous, intra-vaginal, oral). This consistency and stability of safety profile across decades of use, millions of patient exposures, and diverse clinical contexts provides compelling regulatory evidence that the safety profile is robust and unlikely to be materially altered by formulation changes, provided that pharmaceutical equivalence is maintained.

## EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONTEXT AND CLINICAL BURDEN OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS

### Global Epidemiology of Dermatophyte and Candida Infections

Contemporary epidemiological estimates (2009–2023) document that dermatophyte infections affect an estimated 10–15% of the global population at some point during their lifetime, representing a substantial public health burden. Vulvovaginal candidiasis, the most common cause of vaginal infection, affects approximately 70% of women at least once during their reproductive lifetime, with approximately 8–35% of women experiencing recurrent disease (defined as ≥4 episodes per year). Oral candidiasis (oropharyngeal thrush) is particularly prevalent in immunocompromised populations, including individuals with HIV/AIDS (especially with CD4 count <50 cells/mm³), solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression, and patients receiving systemic chemotherapy for malignancy. The economic impact of fungal infections is substantial, encompassing direct healthcare costs (medical consultation, prescription or OTC medications, diagnostic testing) and indirect costs (lost work productivity, reduced quality of life).

The clinical presentation of dermatophyte infections varies with anatomical site and fungal species: tinea pedis (athlete's foot) is the most common dermatophyte infection, affecting the interdigital spaces and soles; tinea corporis (ringworm) presents as circular, scaly lesions on trunk and limbs; tinea cruris (jock itch) affects the groin and intertriginous areas. Non-dermatophyte fungal infections include vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal itching, burning, discharge), candida balanitis (balanoposthitis; penile irritation), oral candidiasis (white plaques on tongue and buccal mucosa), and onychomycosis (fungal nail infection). The prevalence of superficial fungal infections has increased in recent decades, attributable to factors including increasing population mobility, rising prevalence of immunocompromised states (HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy), global warming and increased humidity (creating favourable environments for fungal growth), and possibly selection for antifungal-resistant fungal strains.

### Clinical Management and Therapeutic Patterns

Drug utilisation studies examining patterns of antifungal therapy in dermatological practice demonstrate that topical monotherapy accounts for approximately 37–40% of prescribing encounters, whilst combination therapy (topical antifungal plus systemic antifungal, or topical antifungal plus topical corticosteroid) accounts for 60–62% of prescribing encounters. When combination therapy is employed, the most frequent regimen is oral fluconazole (or less commonly, oral itraconazole) paired with topical clotrimazole, reflecting clinical strategy of combining systemic therapy (to address potential subclinical or systemic dissemination) with local topical therapy (to optimise cutaneous drug delivery and local antifungal concentration). The predominance of combination therapy reflects the chronicity and recurrence-prone nature of many fungal infections, particularly tinea pedis and vulvovaginal candidiasis. Topical antifungal agents are selected in the majority of prescribing encounters (60–70% of antifungal prescriptions include ≥1 topical agent), with clotrimazole accounting for approximately 30–32% of topical prescriptions and market share, confirming its status as a preferred first-line agent. This prescribing pattern is consistent across multiple geographic regions and healthcare systems, suggesting established clinical consensus regarding clotrimazole's efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

## SYNTHESIS: POST-AUTHORISATION EVIDENCE AND ARTICLE 10A REGULATORY JUSTIFICATION FOR WELL-ESTABLISHED USE

### Regulatory Criteria Assessment

Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC establishes three criteria for classification of a pharmaceutical preparation as a well-established medicinal product: (i) continuous, regulated use in the European Union (and/or recognised medicinal use in one of the EU member states) for a minimum of ten years prior to submission of the marketing authorisation application; (ii) recognised efficacy demonstrated through published literature, clinical experience, and expert opinion; and (iii) an acceptable safety profile established through post-marketing surveillance, pharmacovigilance monitoring, and accumulation of clinical experience.

**Criterion 1—Duration of Well-Established Use (Minimum 10 Years in EU)**. Topical clotrimazole has been in continuous, regulated use throughout the European Union since the 1970s–1980s, representing more than 40 years of uninterrupted market presence. Multiple authorised medicinal products containing clotrimazole (including Canesten, branded and generic formulations; Clotrimazol Nutra Essential; Lomexin; Mycelex; and numerous regional and national branded products) have maintained market authorisation and clinical use across all EU member states. Regulatory documentation from the European Medicines Agency and national competent authorities (including the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices [AEMPS], the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [MHRA], the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices [BfArM], and others) confirms continuous authorisation of multiple clotrimazole formulations across the past 40+ years. This long-standing market presence, combined with uninterrupted regulatory approval across EU jurisdictions, unequivocally satisfies the temporal criterion for well-established use.

**Criterion 2—Recognised Efficacy**. The efficacy of topical clotrimazole is recognised through multiple complementary evidence sources: (i) an extensive peer-reviewed literature base documenting efficacy across multiple fungal pathogens and anatomical sites, spanning 45+ years of clinical trials; (ii) real-world effectiveness data demonstrating that published efficacy translates to routine clinical practice, including the Canesten study (93% symptom improvement, 94% quality of life improvement in 475 women) and multiple retrospective tinea studies (75–95% clinical cure rates); (iii) drug utilisation data confirming that clotrimazole is selected as the preferred first-line topical antifungal in approximately 30–32% of antifungal prescriptions, reflecting clinical consensus regarding efficacy; and (iv) market dominance (32.2% OTC market share) reflecting consumer and healthcare provider confidence in clotrimazole's therapeutic benefit. The breadth, depth, and consistency of efficacy evidence across diverse clinical indications (vulvovaginal candidiasis, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, candida balanitis, oral candidiasis, onychomycosis as adjuvant therapy, seborrhoeic dermatitis) and across diverse patient populations (pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, paediatric and elderly patients) provides compelling evidence that clotrimazole efficacy is "recognised" in the regulatory sense. The Mendling systematic review synthesising 37 RCTs and 45 years of clinical experience explicitly establishes that clotrimazole has achieved recognised efficacy status across the full breadth of cutaneous and mucosal fungal indications for which it is indicated.

**Criterion 3—Acceptable Safety Profile**. The safety profile of topical clotrimazole is established as acceptable through multiple converging evidence sources: (i) 40+ years of post-marketing surveillance across EU markets, with no emergence of new serious safety signals or unexpected adverse event patterns; (ii) 45 years of VVC clinical trial data demonstrating consistent, mild adverse effect profiles (predominantly local irritation) and absence of serious toxicity across diverse populations; (iii) minimal systemic toxicity, explained by pharmacokinetic properties demonstrating <10% percutaneous absorption and negligible serum concentrations (<0.001 μg/mL); (iv) excellent tolerability in special populations (pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals) without age or immunological status-dependent safety modifications; (v) absence of clotrimazole from prominent CADR surveillance registries, indicating low incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions relative to other topical medications; (vi) widespread OTC availability across EU without post-market safety restrictions or additional monitoring requirements, reflecting regulatory confidence in safety; and (vii) decades of off-label, unsupervised use (particularly for vaginal clotrimazole products) without emergence of safety concerns. When synthesised, these diverse safety evidence sources establish that clotrimazole has achieved an "acceptable" safety profile in the regulatory sense—characterised by low incidence of mild adverse effects, absence of serious toxicity, and absence of new safety signals across decades of surveillance.

In aggregate, clotrimazole unequivocally meets all three Article 10a regulatory criteria: it has been in continuous, regulated use in the EU for >40 years; it has demonstrated recognised efficacy across multiple indications and populations; and it maintains an acceptable safety profile documented through decades of post-marketing surveillance. The well-established use status of clotrimazole is therefore clearly justified from a regulatory evidence standpoint.

### Pharmaceutical Equivalence Bridging and Clinical Efficacy Waiver

The regulatory pathway for development of novel clotrimazole formulations (such as CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL 10 mg/g Espuma Cutánea) under Article 10a relies upon demonstration of pharmaceutical equivalence (Q1, Q2, Q3) combined with in vitro bioavailability equivalence (IVRT ± IVPT) to justify a waiver of de novo clinical efficacy and safety trials. The theoretical basis for this regulatory approach is that, if a test formulation is demonstrated to be pharmaceutically equivalent (identical composition, identical quantitative content, identical physicochemical properties) and bioavailability-equivalent (identical in vitro release and, if applicable, identical in vitro skin permeation) to a reference medicinal product, then the in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (clinical efficacy and safety) of the test formulation will be equivalent to the reference product. Accordingly, published literature describing the efficacy and safety of the reference product may be relied upon to justify the efficacy and safety of the test formulation, provided that the applicant establishes the relevance of the literature to the test formulation through pharmaceutical and bioavailability equivalence bridging data.

This bridging approach is supported by recent EMA guidance (CHMP Methodology Working Party, July 2025) which clarifies: "In the case of applications which rely on literature to demonstrate safety and efficacy, the relevance of the literature should be supported by equivalence bridging data to the product described in the literature." Accordingly, for CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL 10 mg/g Espuma Cutánea WEU application, the applicant will establish pharmaceutical equivalence (Q1/Q2 identical composition and strength; Q3 identical physicochemical properties) relative to Clotrimazol Nutra Essential 10 mg/g Espuma Cutánea reference product, combined with in vitro bioavailability equivalence (IVRT demonstrating 90–111% equivalence; IVPT recommended as supplemental assurance), and will then cite the extensive literature on clotrimazole (45+ years VVC synthesis, tinea retrospective studies, long-term safety data) to justify that equivalent clinical efficacy and safety are achieved. The reliance on literature rather than de novo clinical trials is justified because (i) clotrimazole efficacy and safety are unequivocally established; (ii) pharmaceutical equivalence ensures that the test formulation has identical pharmacological properties to the reference; (iii) bioavailability equivalence ensures that in vivo exposure (and accordingly, clinical response) is equivalent to the reference; and (iv) the existing literature base directly addresses the clinical effectiveness and safety of clotrimazole formulations in real-world and clinical trial populations, providing ample evidence that pharmaceutical equivalence translates to clinical equivalence.

## IDENTIFIED LIMITATIONS AND EVIDENCE GAPS

The post-authorisation evidence base for topical clotrimazole, whilst comprehensive and robust, exhibits several acknowledged limitations and gaps worthy of explicit recognition:

**Limited Formal FAERS Pharmacovigilance Analysis for Topical Clotrimazole**. Whilst multiple recent pharmacovigilance studies have utilised the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to detect safety signals in systemic antifungals (triazoles, echinocandins) and other medication classes, no dedicated FAERS analysis specifically focusing on topical clotrimazole has been published in recent peer-reviewed literature. This gap reflects both the low absolute number of FAERS reports for OTC topical medications (relative to prescription systemic drugs) and the tendency for pharmacovigilance research to focus on higher-risk medication classes. However, the absence of prominent FAERS signal traffic for topical clotrimazole, in contrast to the substantial FAERS signal documentation for triazole antifungals, is itself informative—suggesting an exceptionally safe post-market profile for topical clotrimazole relative to systemic alternatives.

**Retrospective Study Methodology and Associated Limitations**. The majority of real-world effectiveness evidence (Canesten study, tinea retrospective studies) employs retrospective observational methodology rather than prospective cohort design. Retrospective studies are inherently susceptible to recall bias, selection bias, and incomplete data documentation. However, several features of the available studies mitigate these methodological concerns: (i) the Canesten study employed a six-month lookback period, minimising recall bias relative to longer retrospective intervals; (ii) multiple independent retrospective studies across different geographic regions and healthcare systems reported consistent efficacy findings, reducing the likelihood of reporting bias or systematic error in any single study; (iii) the consistency of retrospective findings with prospective RCT data suggests that retrospective methodology has not materially distorted efficacy estimates; and (iv) retrospective design is appropriate and standard for long-term safety assessments and real-world effectiveness evaluation, and accordingly should not be regarded as a significant methodological limitation for these endpoints.

**Limited Quantification of Adverse Events in Post-Marketing Programmes**. The Canesten real-world evidence study, despite including 475 consumers, did not provide detailed quantified data on frequency and severity of adverse events, instead documenting the absence of reported safety concerns and reporting consumer satisfaction metrics as indirect evidence of safety and tolerability. This reflects the typical post-market reality that well-tolerated OTC products do not generate substantial adverse event reporting unless safety signals emerge. However, this evidentiary gap is mitigated by the extensive quantification of adverse event frequencies (1–5% local irritation, negligible systemic effects) available from the 45-year VVC clinical trial synthesis and from contemporary clinical pharmacology summaries, which provide direct quantified estimates of adverse effect incidence derived from hundreds of prospective clinical studies.

**Geographic Representation and Regulatory Database Coverage**. The majority of contemporary post-authorisation evidence (Canesten study, retrospective tinea studies) originates from English-speaking healthcare systems (UK, Canada, USA). European Union-specific post-marketing surveillance data—particularly from the European Medicines Agency pharmacovigilance database, national competent authority adverse event databases (AEMPS in Spain, EMA in Europe), and European drug utilisation surveys—have not been systematically queried or synthesised in recent publications. However, clotrimazole consumption and efficacy patterns are pharmacologically consistent across geographic regions, and safety signals, if they existed, would be expected to emerge across all healthcare systems with equal likelihood. Accordingly, the absence of geographic variation in safety profile (a well-established pharmacological principle) mitigates the limitation of geographic representation in contemporary publications.

**Absence of Recent Prospective Equivalence Studies**. The post-authorisation evidence base does not include prospective, contemporary comparative bioequivalence or clinical equivalence studies directly comparing clotrimazole foam (or other novel formulations) against established clotrimazole cream or pessary formulations. However, this gap is addressed by the planned IVRT and IVPT bridging studies for CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL, which will provide quantitative in vitro bioavailability data. The absence of recent head-to-head clinical studies is not problematic for Article 10a applications, as the regulatory framework explicitly permits reliance upon literature and equivalence bridging data in lieu of de novo clinical trials, provided that pharmaceutical equivalence and bioavailability equivalence are demonstrated.

## CONCLUSIONS AND REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS

Post-authorisation evidence for topical clotrimazole, synthesised across multiple independent evidence sources (real-world effectiveness studies, retrospective observational analyses, drug utilisation surveys, pharmacovigilance monitoring, long-term clinical experience syntheses, and global consumption data), establishes a comprehensive, consistent, and robust evidence base supporting continued recognition of clotrimazole as a well-established pharmaceutical agent for topical antifungal therapy. Effectiveness is established across multiple dermatological and mucosal fungal indications, with clinical cure or substantial improvement documented in 75–95% of treated patients. Safety is excellent, characterised by predominantly mild local adverse effects (<5% incidence), negligible systemic toxicity (attributable to <10% percutaneous absorption and minimal serum concentrations), and absence of emerging safety signals across decades of post-marketing surveillance. Quality of life improvement is documented in real-world populations (94% in the Canesten study), supporting the clinical relevance of clotrimazole's pharmacological efficacy. Market utilisation patterns (32.2% OTC market share; 91.93% of hospital topical antifungal prescriptions) confirm establishment of clotrimazole as the preferred first-line topical antifungal agent in routine clinical practice.

The post-authorisation evidence base directly supports the Article 10a regulatory pathway for CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL 10 mg/g Espuma Cutánea, a novel foam formulation of clotrimazole. The applicant should (i) establish pharmaceutical equivalence (Q1/Q2/Q3) relative to the reference product Clotrimazol Nutra Essential 10 mg/g Espuma Cutánea through comprehensive quality characterisation; (ii) establish in vitro bioavailability equivalence through comparative IVRT studies (minimum target: 90–111% equivalence; recommended: supplementation with IVPT using ex vivo human skin); (iii) cite the extensive post-authorisation evidence base (Canesten real-world effectiveness study, retrospective tinea studies, 45-year VVC clinical synthesis, StatPearls clinical pharmacology summary, pharmacovigilance data) to justify clinical efficacy and safety; (iv) provide written justification of the relevance of cited literature to the test formulation CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL, grounding this justification in the demonstrated pharmaceutical equivalence and bioavailability equivalence; and (v) submit a standard post-authorisation pharmacovigilance plan consistent with regulatory requirements for OTC topical antifungals, with acknowledgement that the exceptional safety history of clotrimazole does not require enhanced or specialised monitoring.

The extensive post-authorisation evidence base provides compelling regulatory justification for Article 10a marketing authorisation of CLOTRIMAZOL WINADOL, permitting reliance upon published literature rather than requiring de novo clinical efficacy and safety trials. This evidence-based approach preserves resources and accelerates patient access to a novel clotrimazole formulation whilst maintaining robust regulatory oversight through pharmaceutical equivalence and bioavailability bridging requirements.
